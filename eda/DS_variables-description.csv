Variable_Name,Variable_Type,Variable_Definition
STUDYID,character,This variable contains the unique identifier for a study. This is the main key/identifier for all domains in the IDDO Data Repository  every domain table will have the STUDYID identifier.
DOMAIN,character,This variable contains the two-character abbreviation for the domain.
USUBJID,character,"This variable contains the unique subject identifier for a study. This is a secondary key/identifier for all subject-level domains in the IDDO Data Repository  every domain table containing subject-level information (i.e., all but the Trial Domains) will have the USUBJID identifier. This variable will identify unique subjects in the repository."
DSSEQ,number,"This variable contains a sequence number to ensure uniqueness of subject records within the domain. Each observation (each recorded as a separate row in the domain) will have a unique number within each subject, e.g., a subject with 10 observations will have 10 rows and each row is numbered sequentially from 1-10."
DSTERM,character,This variable contains the verbatim wording of the event as provided by the Data Contributor.
DSMODIFY,character,This variable contains a modification of the verbatim wording of the event. This is used to capture IDDO-defined standardised terms of the event.
DSDECOD,character,This variable contains a dictionary-derived text description of the event. This is defined by CDISC Controlled Terminology and IDDO Controlled Terminology. More details can be found in the IDDO Implementation Guide.
VISITNUM,number,This variable contains a number designating the planned clinical encounter number. This is a numeric version of the visit described in VISIT? and it is used for sorting. 
VISIT,character,This variable contains the protocol-defined text description of the planned clinical encounter number (as defined in the Trial Visits (TV) Domain).
VISITDY,number,This variable contains a number designating the Study Day of the planned clinical encounter. This is also a numeric version of the visit described in VISIT? and can be used for sorting.
EPOCH,character,"This variable describes the Epoch period of the observation (e.g., Baseline, Treatment, Follow-up).  This is defined by CDISC Controlled Terminology"
DSDTC,character,"This variable contains the date and time of the collection of the observation, administration of a test or collection of a specimen.  This date and time will be provided in ISO 8601 format."
DSSTDTC,character,This variable contains the start date and time of the observation or initiation of the event (as opposed to the date the question about the observation/event was asked). This date and time will be provided in ISO 8601 format.
DSDY,number,This variable describes the study day of the observation relative to the date in RFSTDTC.  This will be blank for records with no value in the --DTC variable.
DSSTDY,number,This variable describes the study day of the start of the observation relative to the date in RFSTDTC.  This will be blank for records with no value in the --STDTC variable.
DSTPT,character,This variable describes when the observation should have happened as defined in the study protocol. This may be represented as an elapsed time relative to a fixed reference point described in --TPTREF. 
DSTPTREF,character,"This variable contains the name of the fixed reference point referred to by --TPT, --ELTM, e.g. PREVIOUS DOSE, PREVIOUS MEAL."
DSSTRF,character,"This variable describes when the start of the observation happened in relation to the date recorded in RFSTDTC, e.g. BEFORE, DURING or AFTER."
DSEVINTX,character,"This variable contains information about the evaluation interval associated with an observation when it cannot be represented in ISO 8601 format (e.g., ""Last few weeks"", ""While hospitalized"")."
DSSTRTPT,character,"This variable describes when the start of the observation happened in relation to the point described in --STTPT, e.g. BEFORE, DURING or AFTER."
DSSTTPT,character,"This variable contains the name of the fixed reference point referred to by --STRTPT, e.g. PREVIOUS DOSE, 2003-12-15."
DSCDSTDY,number,"This variable contains the contributor-defined study day expressed in integer days relative to the start of the study. This variable is used when no dates are provided, only a contributor-defined proxy. "
DSRPOC,character,This variable describes the reported time period for the occurrence of an event when the actual date/time is not provided. This is provided in ISO 8601 format.
