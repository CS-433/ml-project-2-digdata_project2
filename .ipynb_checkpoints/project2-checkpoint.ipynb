    "In 2019, the first COVID-19 cases are observed in China. Rapidly, the SARS-Cov2 virus spread worldwide, pushing governments to take strict decisions about the lives of their co-citizens, like containment, to protect the population. Indeed, in some cases, COVID-19 patients ended up in intensive care services and sometimes died.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The aim of our model is, based on easily computable parameters at the study's beginning, to predict whether the patient will be likely to die or if the chance of survival is important.** The point of this study is to help the hospital organise in the case of a high number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The studied dataset stem from the IDDO Data Repository of COVID-19 data. This data was pulled from the underlying data collection projects on 2022-09-01. The data comes from 1,200 institutions from over 45 countries and gather various information from 700,000 hospitalised individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep only the relevant features, we first dive into the literature, using Meta-analysis papers. First, we have been looking for aggravating factors that will likely lead the patient to ICU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obesity: according to a meta-analysis by Sales-Peres, there is a correlation between obesity and ICU admission. This paper also concluded that co-morbidities for obese patients, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, smoking habit, lung disease, and/or cardiovascular disease lead to a higher chance of ICU admission.\n",
    "Age: patients aged 70 years and above have a higher risk of infection and a higher need for intensive care than patients younger than 70.\n",
    "Sex: men, when infected, have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease and a higher need for intensive care than women\\cite{pijls_demographic_2021}.\n",
    "Ethnicity: the risk of contamination was higher in most ethnic minority groups than their White counterparts in North America and Europe. Among people with confirmed infection, African-Americans and Hispanic Americans were also more likely than White Americans to be hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the probability of ICU admission was equivalent for all groups. Thus, ethnicity is not relevant to our question. \n",
    "Blood tests: Patients with increased pancreatic enzymes, including elevated serum lipase or amylase of either type, had worse clinical outcomes. Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin; elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin; and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID-19.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of a total of 3009 citations, 17 articles (22 studies, 21 from China and one study from Singapore) with 3396 ranging from 12 to1099 patients were included. Our meta-analyses showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil, hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, serum sodium, lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), leukocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LeCR), leukocyte to IL-6 ratio (LeIR), and an increase in the neutrophil, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, glucose level, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. \n",
    "\n",
    "No significant changes in white blood cells (WBC), Creatine Kinase (CK), troponin I, myoglobin, IL-6 and K between the two groups were observed. "
